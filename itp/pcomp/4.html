          Week 4 - Reviews and Midterm Project

      </h2>
      <p>Me and my teammate have decided to make a Theremin-like instrument, the idea is to not have it only change
        pitch by detecting our hand’s motion but stick to a scale. Maybe we can have a switch to change the scale being
        applied or we can use the notes of a song in jumbled up order and come up with cool alternate melody lines. For
        now, we have managed to install our sensor (Time-of-Fligtht) and read the value and make it shift the pitch of a
        sine wave (or any other wave that is included in the Mozzi audio library). We have ordered an I<sup>2</sup>C
        multiplexer
        because we have decided to use two sensors controlling different elements; we haven’t decided what elements we
        want to
        control using the second sensor yet. Maybe effects, waveshape, volume.
