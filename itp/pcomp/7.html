          Week 7 - Serial Communication
        </a>
      </h2>
      <p>
        I had skimmed the surface of this week's material before, when I was helping another student figure out how to
        connect
        her slider to her p5 sketch. But I spent a little extra time fiddling around with the bare bones of serial
        communication. I noticed when I tried to read the serial data directly with a node script and logged it to the
        console it would get printed as a buffer object, no matter which parser I used I only received buffer objects.
        I'm still a little confused as to why this is happening.
      </p>

        But the p5.webserial library is extremely useful and makes the whole process a lot easier. A serial
        communication can be set up and be ready to go in seconds. I just wish my input were a little less noisy, I had
        the idea of controlling a dot with a potentiometer.

      <p>And using the serial communication the other way around was as easy. These basic building blocks can really
        spark the imagination.</p>
