        Me and Daniel decided to work on a spooky Theremin-like musical instrument, we used two time-of-flight sensors
        to
        get the user input and mapped those readings to various parameters of the sound. We started by implementing
        simple audio synthesis using the <a href="https://sensorium.github.io/Mozzi/" target="_blank">Mozzi library</a>
        since it had added functionality and classes compared to the built-in tone function of the Arduino Nano. Then we
        ordered an I<sup>2</sup>C multiplexer to get a reading from both of our sensors. We noticed that the multiplexer
        for some reason detected two I<sup>2</sup>C breakout boards on all the ports. I searched around the net and
        found that people had similar issues, seems to be a bug in certain chips but it apparently does not affect the
        output (<a href="https://forums.adafruit.com/viewtopic.php?f=19&t=104492" target="_blank">link to the forum
          this was discussed</a> and screenshot of Adafruit support's message below). It took us a while to figure out a
        proper
        code that would get us a reading from both of the
        sensors.

        Once we could get a reading from the sensors and had the ability to switch between them, we had to figure out
        what we wanted each sensor to do. We initially had lots of ideas in mind but then we faced the limitations of
        the Arduino Nano and the Mozzi library. But within their abilities, we impletmented delay and filter effects.
        Also a square wave was used to get a saturated and rich tone. One thing I noticed with our readings, was that
        when we mapped the reading to our target range, most often we wouldn't want our input range to have a minimum of
        zero or less
        than 40, but the normal map function would output unreliable results once it got an input value lower than the
        input minimum, so I wrote my own map function with a workaround:

        Then we added a switch to control between several
        states, everytime the switch is pressed the state changes and once it reaches the 4th state it loops back to the
        first one. The first state uses an EventDelay which is equivalent to the normal delay in Arduino's library.
        Within the delayed period, we can hear a pitch drop. One of the sensors changes the interval between event
        delays
        and the other one changes the initial beginning pitch. The second one was our attempt at creating a scale and
        mapping the reading of our sensors to the notes within that scale. I personally expected a more defined pitch
        generation but I guess the Arduino Nano 33 IoT's hardware is not ideal for sound synthesis. Still we could get
        some interesting chiptune-like effects. The third state implements a lowpass filter, one sensor changes the
        notes on a scale and the other controls the cutoff frequency of our filter. The fourth state is a feedback
        delay, but as mentioned in the reference of the mozzi library the range of the delaytime is between 0 and 7
        milliseconds, which is hardly noticeable to the human ear. Once the delaytime is below 20ms even if technically
        it is a delay, most often it is referred to as a chorus or a modulation effect.

        This project in my opinion was a great introduction to sound synthesis and sound manipulation using the bare
        minimum. It was a challenge to be stripped off of all the musical advancements that we take for granted and work
        with a voltage and a speaker and a microcontroller. The limitations of the Arduino Nano definitely changed the
        course of our project development. The delay is not at all what one would expect from a delay effect but given
        the
        limited memory, it's not possible to have a long delay buffer and hence we had to work with what we
        had. Despite all the frustrations with things not working as we expected, I had lots of fun and eureka moments
        throughout the development of this project.
