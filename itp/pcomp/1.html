          Week 1 - Basics

      </h2>
      <p>
        First week, the basics. Most of the stuff were familiar from high school years but I had forgotten the exact
        definitions of them. Like what voltage exactly means (the difference in potential electrical energy between two
        points in a circuit) and how it relates to current (magnitude of flow of electrons in a point in a circut) and
        resistance (measure of a material's nonconductiveness or how much it resists the flow of electricity). As
        demonstrated by
        Ohm's law voltage equals current times resistance which is a handy formula that demonstrates the relationship
        between the three phenomena.

        Following that some simple circuts were shown that I could build using the parts and the breadboard I had, I
        powered the Arduino board using my laptop and got it to turn on an LED light with a switch.
