      Week 1
    </h3>
    <p>For our first project, we are supposed to make a phone add-on.</p>
    <p>Some initial ideas we've had:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>tripod that's connected to the phone</li>
      <li>IR addon for your phone</li>
      <li>any sensor addition to your phone</li>
      <li>usb-c to RCA</li>
      <li>breathalyzer sensor for your phone that calls emergency contact</li>
      <li>Midi interface addon for your phone / touch capacitive sensors</li>
      <li>Guitar pickup add on</li>
      <li><s>An LED strip / a phone case or a display or something like that that only lights up when you receive
          notifications or calls from a certain contact</s> A phone stand that lights up different-colored LEDs
        depending on the notification received (Morse code or binary).</li>
      <li>An audio speaker that plays the note sequence that's received by a text message</li>
    </ul>
