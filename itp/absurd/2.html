      Week 2
    </h3>
    <p>Chindogu is a Japanese art movement that involves the invention of "unuseless" gadgets. Chindogu devices are
      purposefully impractical, humorous creations that are meant to make people think creatively. The word "chindogu"
      combines the Japanese words for "strange" and "tool."
    </p>
    <p>
      On the positive side, I think, chindogu encourages innovative thinking and humor. The whimsical nature of chindogu
      inventions provides amusement and pushes problem solvers to come up with novel solutions. Chindogu artists eschew
      usefulness and practicality in favor of sparking the imagination. This allows for free brainstorming without
      constraints.
      The satirical nature of chindogu pokes fun at overly complex solutions to
      simple problems.

    <p>
      However, one may argue that chindogu represents inefficient excess and needless consumerism. In a world facing
      environmental crisis, designing intentionally impractical devices could be seen as frivolous and wasteful. Mass
      producing whimsical items with no real function misdirects energy and resources. Which is actually where I think
      rule number five comes to play, which is "Chindogu is not for sale"
    </p>
    <p>
      But overall my feeling is that chindogu represents a positive spark of creativity.
      The playful spirit of chindogu encourages new ways of thinking and sometimes even with the freedom of not worrying
      about the actual usefulness of the thing you're designing. Overall, chindogu provides an interesting glimpse into
      innovation through
      the lens of whimsy.</p>
