      Absurd Hotel
    </h3>
    <h4 style="background-color: #FFFF00;">Ideation</h4>
    <p>The ideation process for this one took the longest. We had many ideas but none of them seemed to be useful or
      unuseless enough to be presentable in this hotel. Our very first ideas were:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>An overhead light for bed that has sliding sides so that the user can close one side and have light on the
        other side only while reading at night.</li>
      <li>A contraption attached to a bedside lamp that's protruding and can be used to concentrate light in one point.
      </li>
      <li>An overhead curtain on your bed's headboard so that you can slide into and have privacy while being in the
        same space with your partner. <i style="background-color: aquamarine; font-size: 16px; padding: .5em;">(We went
          really crazy
          with
          this one and started imagining a whole installation
          of
          a huge curtain that the user can slide around and have privacy in different spots in the room, with a light
          inside and a fabric that's breathable, we even did some research on how to find the right material for it but
          upon having a meeting with our instructor we decided to let go of the idea because it wasn't serving the
          purpose
          of the assignment and also not very practical to make in a week.)</i></li>
      <li>
        An ashtray that's designed for rooms that are non-smoking, it has a mechanism that sucks the cigarette in and/or
        cuts it in half when you put it in the ashtray.<i
          style="background-color: rgb(205, 255, 240); font-size: 16px; padding: .5em;"> (We thought this idea was too
          specific and not very useful.)</i>
      </li>
      <li>
        A modified chopstick set that is presented to you by the waiter, you can choose your weapon depending on the
        dish and your mood, there are different types of chopsticks, some have containers up at the top for salt,
        pepper, one has a container and a special design to dispense soy sauce, one has a tiny little grinder for
        grinding spices, etc.<i style="background-color:blanchedalmond; font-size: 16px; padding: .5em;">
          Upon further thinking we thought that this idea wasn't really solving a problem. Although
          it was one of my favorite ideas that we had out of all of our ideas.</i>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Chosen Idea:</strong><span style="background-color:#FFFF00;">
          A sleep mask that's an alarm for you to wake up without bothering other people
          in
          the room. The sleep mask has
          a curtain that covers the front, which will roll up when it's time to wake up, it also has vibrating modules
          placed around it so that you actually wake up via the haptic feedback. It is paired with your phone for ease
          of
          use.</span></li>
    </ul>

    <h4 style="background-color: #FFFF00;">CMF And Progress on the Finalized Idea</h4>
    <p>In terms of CMF, we've decided to use a safety goggles as the base of our sleeping mask, we know that a structure
      is necessary since we're planning to have solid objects attached to it like a rod and a motor etc. It will for
      sure be a challenge to come up with a form that has a structure but is also comfortable to wear.</p>
    <p>There will be an inner layer of fabric covering the goggles and anything attached to it. There will be a second
      layer with a cushion-like design that both houses the electronics and also makes it comfortable to wear. The
      material for the rod and the knob will be plastic and we are planning to paint the knob the apple green color to
      indicate a <span style="background-color: #FFFF00;">point of interaction</span>.</p>

    <p>I ordered the Seeed Studio Xiao BLE, since it's a very small microcontroller with BLE enabled. I developed an
      alarm app using Android Studio and Kotlin, it pairs with the microcontroller and sends a trigger message to the
      modules and the motor to activate them. </p>

    <i>Put things together for the first time, attached the rod and the knob and adjusted the motor speed so that it
      turns with a relatively slow speed but also strong enough to turn while constrained by the fabric and the wooden
      handles.</i>
