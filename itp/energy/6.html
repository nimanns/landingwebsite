      The subject of blockchain and its energy use has been an ongoing debate since it started being implemented more
      and more. I remember power outages happened very frequently in my home country Iran during the peak high prices of
      crypto because of the process that is called mining. According to <a
        href="https://www.visualcapitalist.com/visualizing-the-power-consumption-of-bitcoin-mining/" target="_blank">
        Visual Capitalist
      </a>
      the yearly power consumption of the blockchain network for bitcoin is 129 TWh, the table also shows the number in
      comparison to some countries and companies. The fact that a blockchain network requires more power than a whole
      country (Norway) is mindblowing and concerning.

      The main issue with energy consumption is what is known as <span style="background-color: lime; padding:.1em">
        proof
        of work.</span> It basically means that a huge network of computers are trying their best to solve unnecessarily
      complicated mathematical problems to sign or mine a block in the network. In the recent years there have been
      alternatives to this one of which is the concept known as <span style="background-color: lime; padding:.1em">
        proof
        of stake.</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      Proof of Stake (PoS) is a consensus algorithm used by some blockchain networks to validate transactions and add
      new blocks to the blockchain. Unlike the Proof of Work (PoW) consensus algorithm, which relies on computational
      power and energy-intensive mining processes to validate transactions and create new blocks, PoS relies on a
      different mechanism that can significantly reduce energy consumption.

      In a PoS blockchain network, validators are chosen to add new blocks to the blockchain based on the amount of
      cryptocurrency they hold or "stake" in the network. Validators are incentivized to act honestly, as they risk
      losing their staked coins if they attempt to validate fraudulent transactions. This system ensures that the
      validators have a financial stake in the network and are motivated to act in the best interests of the network.

    </p>
    <p>
      The energy consumption of PoS is much lower than that of PoW because it eliminates the need for mining hardware
      and the associated energy consumption. The PoS consensus algorithm can be implemented on a regular computer or
      even a smartphone, making it accessible to a wider range of users. This significantly reduces the carbon footprint
      of the blockchain network and makes it more environmentally friendly.
    </p>
    <p>There are other more environment-friendly methods too, which I'm still looking into and learning about like <a
        style="background-color: aqua; padding:.1em;" href="https://www.chia.net/technology/" target="_blank">Chia.</a>
      which uses an alternative called <a href="https://www.chia.net/faq/#faq-3" target="_blank"
        style="background-color: lime; padding: .1em;">proof of space and
        time</a>.</p>
    <p>Excited to look more into the measurements of these alternative approaches and how they actually compare to PoW.
