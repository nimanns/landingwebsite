    <h3>Week 1</h3>
    <p>The reality of decarbonization and net-zero emissions has always been a daunting one for me. I don’t think we as
      a planet have done enough to reach anywhere close to net-zero. Alternatives that we have just seem so
      cost-inefficient and dependent on secondary variables (like weather conditions) that we just can’t think of them
      as a large-scale alternative to the current carbon-inducing sources. Among the alternatives, nuclear actually
      seems like a viable one but it also can be a double-edged sword in that there are many safety concerns. The
      nuclear waste and its disposal is a great challenge. It remains radioactive and is hazardous for thousands of
      years and there seems to be no safe way of getting rid of it. Cost of building and maintaining them is another
      factor. In addition, where countries stand politically has a huge role to play in this regard, certain governments
      may use green, nuclear power as an excuse for their evil purposes behind the scenes to obtain nuclear weapons.

      I’m looking forward to learning more about ways in which carbon-free energy can be achieved. I also just want to
      build projects that are independent of any outside source of power whether they are just tools for certain
      purposes or just an art piece.
