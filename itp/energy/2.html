    <h3>Week 2</h3>
    <p>
      I really enjoyed this week's readings.
      I found the comic really fascinating. The amount of energy that we take for granted in our everyday lives depicted
      as human labor is really eye-opening in terms of how much energy is consumed collectively in seconds and how much
      of a challenge it is to produce that. And the article on energy scavenging had really novel ideas that I had no
      idea were possible, the one that stands out for me personally are the thermoelectric and ambient light ones, never
      thought actual applications of turning them into energy would be possible.

    <p>For our kinetic project, we have decided to work on a roller paint brush, figure out a way to mount the motor to
      the actual roller, and then use the electricity from that to light up a strip of LEDs. </p>
