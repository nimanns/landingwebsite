      I have really been fascinated by the works of a company called Ithaca. They specialize in sound and light
      installations and in my opinion having the accompanying sound effects makes the light installations much more
      impressive.

    <p>The first time I saw a work by them was "Sea of Light", it was a grandiose merge of lighting and sound, the way
      the LEDs were reactive to the sound being played was fascinating. I later found out that another work of them was
      in display in the botanical garden at Brooklyn. I went to experience it in person and it was nothing short of what
      I had anticipated. Truly mesmerizing, the movement property of lighting was really apparent there. The sounds were
      coordinated so well with the LEDs changing color and also turning on and off to show movement.
