      <h2>
        Week 2 - SoundWalk
      </h2>
      <p>
        At first we had no set narrative in mind, we just wandered around collecting samples. Once a bulk of sound
        samples were collected, Mashi mentioned how the wooden installation kind of sounds likes a bunch of bugs flying
        around
        flapping their wings. We all knew at some point that we wanted something horror and
        supernatural. We had recordings of a mini jam session we did using the piano and the guitar at the ITP
        hallway, using various audio effects it was transformed into a bed of pad-like textures that we decided to use
        as a soundtrack to the struggles of the main character. We also had a sample that included a faint ice cream
        truck sound in the background which gave us the vibe we were after. We edited on our own for a couple of
        days then we
        met and put all of our final ideas together and did some final touches and constructed a 2:48 piece that we're
        really proud of!
