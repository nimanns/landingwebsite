      <h2>Week 9&10 - AR</h2>
      <p>
        The final form our AR project took was in outer space, our assets floating in the depths of the space, we had
        the famous James Webb telescope's capture of the deeper space as our background, and aligned our assets which
        were pacman and ghosts on top of it. We discussed how this could protray our vulnerability in outer space, where
        we are sorrounded by danger (the ghosts). We also used some starter assets from Adobe Aero (planets) to give our
        space some depth. We also used a new asset which was a meteor shower like gif, to add movement to our scene. We
        then arrenged all the movements and loops inside Adobe Aero and had it displayed on top of a table in class.
        Overall this has been a fun project, I explored lots of new realms that I had no idea existed, I may revisit
        certain aspects of these technologies for future use but overall, this kind of technology and media is not as
        accessible as I hoped it to be yet. I couldn't get the app to work on my Android phone which was quite
        frustrating. Even then, where do you release this kind of art. Is there a marketplace for it out there? Do most
        people even know it exists? I doubt that we are there yet. But I can see how certain parts could be useful as an
        immersive and interactive performance.
