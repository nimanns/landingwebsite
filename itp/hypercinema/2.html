      <h2>
        Week 2 - On the Rights of Molotov Man
      </h2>
      <p>The piece is regarding a conflict between painter and artist Joy Garnett and photographer Susan Meiselas on
        fair use of a photograph of a man now famously recognized as the Molotov Man. In part, it introduces us to a
        point of view
        that
        an
        artist should be free to use contents of others' works to create, express and
        flourish. We take in
        inspirations in many
        shapes and forms and whatever comes out is nothing but a carefully crafted amalgamation of that input. I can't
        remember where I've read this quote that goes: "To steal ideas from one person is plagiarism; to steal from many
        is research." there is some truth to that. No artist can claim to be original in all aspects of their art, their
        art is a product of what they have consumed throughout their careers and even before their careers when they
        were learning the craft. But you have to be aware of certain boundaries. Of course, downright copying of
        another's work adding nothing in the process would rightfully be frowned upon.</p>
      <p>In terms of protecting the context of a piece, when Susan talks about how she wants the Molotov Man to remain
        attached to those specific historic events in Nicaragua and not riots or combat in general, she has a point. I
        can totally see how an artist would feel when the narrative attached to their work is stripped away and is
        placed in a totally novel context. It no longer relates to the events or the incidents that the original work
        was inspired by in any shape or form. It removes the wonder engraved in the work that was captured in that very
        moment in time in favor of being creative. I believe artists should be the ones to decide whether they want
        further collaboration and free use of their content or not. </p>
      <p>As I read what Joy had to say when discovering the original photograph (“I was fascinated by the original image
        and the richness of the narrative behind it, but it didn't make any difference to me in terms of permission or
        credit”) I was a little shocked. It was clearly appropriate to credit or ask for permission. Even if the
        original work is not recognized or celebrated in any context, the artist should still consider asking for
        permission. Legal matters aside, in my belief this is a big part of the respect you pay to other fellow artists’
        works and the narrative behind them. </p>
      <p>I can totally get that artists’ creative process may involve unexpected turns. Things that you don’t pay much
        attention in the messy process of creating something can lead to problems later. I think being mindful of the
        fact that mistakes happen and taking a step back to resolve it is the best way to go forward. Although things
        aren’t always straightforward like that, there have been numerous instances where some have misused copyright
        infringement laws to gain wealth and/or diminish the work of others. I can’t; however, disregard the
        decontextualization of a piece and how much it can damage the work or the artist’s wellbeing and believe that
        certain rules must exist and be abided by.</p>
