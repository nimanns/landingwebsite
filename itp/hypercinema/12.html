      <h2>Week 13&14 - Cornell Box and Unreal Engine</h2>
      <p>My cornell box project in unreal has taken some drastic twists. I initailly started working on a sound studio
        environment, I put up the walls and set up the inner decoration with lights, but had a hard time acquiring
        necessary assets, I could not find proper assets with details all of the ones I liked were paid. So I decided to
        stick to the lighting that I had, and build on top of it, making it the central focus. I've always liked purple
        and pink lighting in games that I've played, I just love how it sets a certain mood in the room. I tried to
        apply various materials to find the most reflective one, but I didn't want it to be too reflecting. I loved to
        include bunch of cat statues because I love cats and want to include them everywhere.</p>
      <p>One thing I did not like about the overall workflow was how the spotlight functions, it's not intuitive at all!
        I couldn't get it to light up the items I wanted with the values that made sense to me, I had to play around
        with the inner and outer cone sizes so much to arrive at a number that could actually project some light on the
        object. Maybe there's something I'm missing but it was frustrating to work with them. I also tried to scan and
        import my audio interface to put it near my guitar in the room, but for some reason the application that I tried
        (KIRI Engine - 3D Scanner) kept throwing errors and would not construct a 3D model from my pictures, I couldn't
        find a good alternative for android.</p>

      <p>Other than that I'm quite happy with the result, I love the mood, I love the colors of the lights, I think I
        could be more intentional with the statues that I have chosen, but not many assets I had in mind were available
        for free, so my options were limited in that sense.</p>
