      <h2>Week 7 - Animation Storyboarding</h2>
      <p>After brainstorming for a while, we landed on the idea of bringing Siri, the famous iPhone assistant to life.
        The following is the storyline and the story board we came up with:</p>
      <p>
        Siri (she’s 12)
        Siri’s bug - Bug
        Ladybug
        Synopsis:
        Siri has a bug. Bug meets Ladybug. Bug “falls out” of Siri, and falls in love with Ladybug, and
        Siri gets fixed too.
        Story
        Siri wakes up and comes out of the bed, which is an iPhone, when the alarm clock goes off. Siri
        goes to the bathroom (garbage collector), washes her face with (some liquid). She’s walking
        funny to the bathroom. Siri drinks something hot (maybe a cup of memories), and eats cereal
        (chips with milk). Siri scrolls through her phone, which is an Android, or Sony, or Samsung. Siri
        crashes into something (similar to the deer in the video game). (She passes two exceptions,
        and then she crashes like the deer). Ladybug appears from a plant that is sitting somewhere in
        the apartment. Bug sees Ladybug from the LED screen on Siri, which also is a window for

        him/they. Bug jumps out and meets Ladybug. - The End-
      </p>

        Things to figure out:

        Siri’s house
        Bathroom
        Siri’s size
        What is the texts saying?
        - What’s the language?
        - Does she remember the images?
        - Exceptions in programming

      </p>
