      <h2>Week 8 - AR/Assets</h2>
      <p>
        After we realized our notion of what we were supposed to do had been totally wrong, we decided to alter our
        storyline to make it fit the AR world we are trying to make. First of all we wanted to make it super simple, as
        we are being introduced to all these new topics and pieces of software, we don't want any complications of the
        storyline getting in the way. We decided to get rid of most of the nuances of our story. What is retro, simple
        and cool? Pacman. We prepared our assets based on the characters of the game itself. At this point we had
        decided to let go of Siri completely. Initially we had the idea of showcasing our pacman shenanigans on the
        chest of a robot which resembled Siri, but after giving it a second thought, Siri being there was completely
        irrelevant. So we have prepared our assets, and have been trying to figure out specific animations to move our
        assets around and bring them to life.

      <p>We were finding it hard to get rid of Siri, this is a second iteration of our storyboard in which we wanted
        to make the first storyline simpler, but we cumulatively agreed that we didn't want to stare into bugs and
        animate them for hours on end.</p>
      <div style="width:100%; display:grid; padding:1em; gap:1em">
        <img style="width:50%;margin:0 auto;" src="./9/1.jpg" />

      <p>Final assets that we've agreed upon.</p>
