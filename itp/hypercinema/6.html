      <h2>Week 5 - Synthetic Media</h2>
      <p>
        The main challenge we faced in our process was to turn still images into a cohesive video narration. We had no
        idea how we could animate hands and feet or facial expressions of our characters. We decided to be experimental
        instead, we used Adobe Premiere to learn about applying effects and making smooth and glitchy transitions
        that were not slideshow-like. The back theme we were thinking the whole time was alien-like natural life forms,
        biological evolution etc. The result was a video showcasing our AI-made images with lots of glitches and
        seamless transitions. The music in the first half is AI-generated but I have done edits to make it even more
        glitchy and machine-like. Personally, this is not what I do when I want to be creative, but I think this project
        has been an eye-opener in terms of alternatives to my normal routine, and there are elements that may benefit my
        future pursuits in the field of creation.
