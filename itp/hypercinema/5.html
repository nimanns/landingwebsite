      <h2>Week 4 - AI Tools</h2>
      <p>
        For me using AI tools is not the typical route I would take when being creative. But it was a nice
        change in the course of actions and it was definitely uncharted territory for me. Me and my groupmate decided to
        stick to supernatural images intertwined with natural elements. We wanted our images to be somewhat uncanny but
        also resembling the natural environment of our planet. We also wanted to have lots of humanoid type robots as
        servants to humanity. We were imagining a storyline that was the exact opposite of most sci fi which is AI
        taking over humanity. Rather we envisioned a future where AI creatures were servants and were planning to stand
        up and fight for an equal presence.

        Considering the storyline, a horror theme would fit our piece. I digged through and found a long composition
        made by an AI, it sounded eerie, just what we were looking for. I did some editting and perhaps using some other
        video editing tools we can turn these images into a video. For these images we have used Dall-E and Midjourney.
