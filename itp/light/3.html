      Week 3
    </h3>
    <p>This week we were supposed to build a controller for a 12-volt light controller, the schematic was pretty
      straightforward. With an arduino connected to a MOSFET transistor controlling the ground of the 12 volt light. I
      used a protoboard to solder all the parts and have a solid and permanent rig.</p>

    <p>I played around with the input to make it less noisy and shaky, with no avail. I tried adding a delay which
      helped but also introduced latency. Then as suggested in class I tried the Kalman filter which helped a lot with
      the smoothing of the reading of my pot. Made the fade a lot smoother and almost no flickers with lower values.</p>
