      Final Project Ideas
    </h3>
    <p>We have discussed on the possibility of coming up with a way to detect gestures to control the brightness and the
      state of our lamp, perhaps using distance sensors and detecting a pattern in the value changes to find out the
      type of gesture. Would be ideal to train a model on the gestures and the input but I don't know using a
      microcontroller how possible that is. And we have also looked into the touch capacitive sensors as an alternative.
