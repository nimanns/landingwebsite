      Final Project Progress
    </h3>
    <p>We decided to go with a design similar to <a
        href="https://www.aliexpress.com/i/3256802142857332.html?gatewayAdapt=4itemAdapt" target="_blank">this
        light</a>. Although we have some challenging ideas for the interaction and the design, we agreed that we would
      focus on having an MVP with a touch potentiometer and a switch, and work on the gesture detection and machine
      learning side of the project, if it fails still it was worth exploring and we at least will have a working
      project, so we don't want to invest everything on that, but I think the whole idea is appealing enough to at least
      try.</p>

    <p>For now we made a quick prototype using laser-cut cardboard to see how the light would scatter and look in the
      middle of our fixture, and the results are interesting, I like how this shape scatters the light around it.</p>

    <p>I also tried 3D modeling a few shapes similar to the light, we definitely want to add our own flavor to the shape
      and don't want to downright copy this product.

    <h4>Fades</h4>
    <p>We like the idea of using fades for a smooth-feeling user interaction. The simple linear and exponential curves
      are fine but I wanted to explore more so I had the thought of finding a way to implement a cubic bezier curve to
      control the fade of the light, after many hours of coding and debugging I could arrive to a working solution that
      is basically a 6-point bezier curve to fade the light on and off.</p>
    <p>Because the camera oversaturates and can not capture the proper effect of the fade, I pointed the light to a wall
      and tried to capture the curve as much as possible, the turning off curve is more pronounced</p>

    <p>And here is a slow motion of the light bulb to see the effect closer</p>

    <p>The next steps are clear, we have to start fabricating a few other prototypes with a similar shape but altered
      with our own tastes, and in parallel we continue working on the gesture detection, but keep the touch fader in
      place as a safe plan B.</p>
