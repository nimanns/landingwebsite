      Hue Bulbs
    </h3>
    <p>
      After playing around with philips hue bulbs, I think they are convinient for some use cases while not so much for
      other ones. I like that I can have control over their hue, brightness and lots of other variables simply by doing
      an html request, feels so easy to implement and easy to use, although the bulb that I had did not have a hue
      control. But I think overall I don't like the fact that I need a hub, and a network sandbox for the whole thing to
      work, it could be a nice setup at home or on an installation, but I personally prefer things to be minimal and
      ready to go without depending on external devices. Also considering the time it takes for the request to reach the
      router and the hub, there will always be a delay between the time I adjust my controls and see the light change,
      so I was thinking it would be a good idea to have an indicator, maybe a neopixel on the controller to show me some
      instant optimistic feedback on the values that I was changing.
