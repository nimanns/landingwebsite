    <p>
      For this week's assignment we were supposed to fade an LED with an interrupting input. I was not sure what
      interruptible fade meant in this case, so I tried my best to comply with various scenarios. I first coded the
      arduino to recieve the input from a push button and then stop where the brightness was once the button was pushed.
      I chose the exponential fade curve because it was the smoothest one to my eyes. Then I programmed the arduino to
      detect double pushes of the button, and change the speed of the fade. So double-pushing the button will change the
      speed from 5 to 10 to 15 and back to 5; sort of like a toggle between three states.
